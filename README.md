# IoT-Based Electricity Theft Detection System

This repository contains my **published research paper** titled  
**“IoT-Based Electricity Theft Detection System”**, focusing on the detection of
non-technical losses (electricity theft) in power distribution systems using IoT.

The work proposes a **dual-meter comparison approach** to identify unauthorized
power tapping before the consumer meter, enabling real-time monitoring and alerts.

## 🔍 Abstract
Electricity theft is a major contributor to non-technical losses in power
distribution networks. This research presents an IoT-based system that compares
energy consumption data from two meters—one at the distribution side and one at
the consumer end—to detect discrepancies in real time. The proposed system
supports automated alerts, remote monitoring, and improved transparency, making
it suitable for smart grid applications.
